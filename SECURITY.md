# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations, best practices, and reporting procedures for the Starknet Solo Staking Validator setup.

## Security Model

### Threat Model
- **External Attackers**: Attempting to gain unauthorized access to validator or funds
- **Network Attacks**: DDoS, eclipse attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Software Vulnerabilities**: Bugs in client software or dependencies
- **Operational Errors**: Misconfigurations, key management mistakes
- **Physical Security**: Unauthorized access to validator hardware

### Security Principles
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions and access rights
3. **Fail Secure**: System fails to secure state when possible
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and alerting

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Key Management
- **NEVER** store private keys in plain text
- Use hardware wallets for staking addresses
- Encrypt all keystore files with strong passwords
- Use separate operational keys with minimal funding
- Regularly rotate operational keys

### 2. Network Security
- Run validator on dedicated, hardened hardware
- Use firewall to block unnecessary ports
- Implement fail2ban for SSH protection
- Use VPN for remote access
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

### 3. System Security
- Keep operating system and software updated
- Use minimal system installations
- Disable unnecessary services
- Implement proper user permissions
- Use secure boot and full disk encryption

### 4. Docker Security
- Use official Docker images only
- Regularly update container images
- Run containers as non-root users
- Limit container capabilities
- Use read-only filesystems where possible

### 5. Monitoring
- Monitor validator performance and health
- Set up alerts for critical events
- Monitor system resources and disk space
- Track network connectivity
- Monitor for unusual activity

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. API Exposure
- **Issue**: APIs bound to localhost only
- **Risk**: Low - not accessible externally
- **Mitigation**: Firewall rules block external access

### 2. JWT Secret
- **Issue**: JWT secret stored in plain text
- **Risk**: Medium - if file system is compromised
- **Mitigation**: Proper file permissions (600)

### 3. Container Privileges
- **Issue**: Containers run with default privileges
- **Risk**: Medium - potential privilege escalation
- **Mitigation**: Docker security best practices

### 4. Backup Security
- **Issue**: Backups may contain sensitive data
- **Risk**: Medium - if backups are compromised
- **Mitigation**: Encrypt backups, secure storage

## Security Checklist for Deployment

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Review all configuration files for hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Verify firewall rules are properly configured
- [ ] Ensure all software is updated to latest versions
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Verify monitoring and alerting works
- [ ] Review access controls and permissions

### During Deployment
- [ ] Use secure communication channels
- [ ] Verify checksums of all downloaded files
- [ ] Follow principle of least privilege
- [ ] Document all configuration changes
- [ ] Test all security controls

### After Deployment
- [ ] Monitor logs for unusual activity
- [ ] Verify all services are running correctly
- [ ] Test incident response procedures
- [ ] Review and update security documentation
- [ ] Schedule regular security reviews
